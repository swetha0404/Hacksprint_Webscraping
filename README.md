# üï∏Ô∏è Web Scraping Automation Project ‚Äî Hacksprint v3.0

## üè´ Hackathon Submission
**Event:** Hacksprint v2.0 & v3.0  
**Organized by:** Marathwada Mitra Mandal's College of Engineering, Pune, India  
**Team ID:** HS302_PS11

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to automate the extraction of company-related data from publicly accessible sources such as **Zauba Corp**, which provides company registry information in India. It is built to support:

- Gathering official company URLs
- Extracting director and corporate structure information
- Exporting scraped data to Excel sheets for analysis and reporting

The solution was implemented using **Python and BeautifulSoup** and includes Jupyter notebooks and a `.py` automation script.

## üìÇ Key Components

### üß† Core Script Logic
The main application automates:
- Visiting the [CIBIL Suit Filed Data Portal](https://suit.cibil.com/)
- Selecting a reporting period using Selenium and downloading a company report
- Reading the downloaded Excel file (using `xlrd`)
- Searching ZaubaCorp for each company's CIN (Corporate Identification Number), director names, and company profile URL via `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Writing structured results into a new Excel file using `openpyxl`

It features a GUI built with **Tkinter**, allowing users to:
- Choose a reporting quarter (dynamically scraped from CIBIL)
- Click a button to initiate download, scraping, and export
- Receive confirmation popups when tasks are complete
- `ZaubaToExcel.py`: Script to scrape company data and export to Excel
- `Final Project.ipynb`: Main notebook orchestrating the scraping flow
- `companyURL.ipynb` + variants: Extract URLs and information via HTML parsing
- `URL of Companies.xls`: Input Excel file with initial company names or URLs
- `cgSummaryReport_1601003730608.xls`: Sample scraped data output
- `HS302_PS11_Presentation.pptx`: Project presentation slides
- `Demo video_Team CKR.mp4`: Short demo of the working solution

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl`
2. Place the company names/URLs in `URL of Companies.xls`
3. Run `ZaubaToExcel.py` or execute notebooks in order
4. Output will be saved as `.xls` or `.xlsx` reports
